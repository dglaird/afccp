# üõ†Ô∏è Installation Instructions for AFCCP

This guide walks you through setting up the **Air Force Cadet Career Problem (AFCCP)** repository using **PyCharm** and **Anaconda**. You‚Äôll first clone the repository using terminal, then choose between two setup options:
- Using **Terminal**
- Using **PyCharm‚Äôs GUI**

---

## üì• 1. Install Required Tools

### ‚úÖ Required:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (Python 3.8+)
- [PyCharm Community or Professional Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We recommend the **Professional Edition** if you have access, but the **Community Edition** works fine too.

Personally, I love PyCharm and will always recommend it as the go-to python IDE! If you'd like to get started with 
PyCharm, you can follow my [PyCharm Instructions](pycharm-instructions.md).

---

## üåÄ 2. Clone the AFCCP Repository

Use your terminal (Mac/Linux: Terminal, Windows: Anaconda Prompt or Git Bash). First navigate to your desired
directory to clone this project. I have a folder called "Coding Projects" where I keep all of my python 
projects:

```bash
cd "/Users/griffenlaird/Coding Projects"
```

Once you're in the directory you want to clone afccp to, clone it!:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dglaird/afccp.git
cd afccp
```

When you clone the repo, you should see some output that looks like this:

<pre>
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dglaird/afccp.git
Cloning into 'afccp'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 108, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (108/108), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (82/82), done.
Receiving objects: 100% (108/108), 120.34 KiB | 2.35 MiB/s, done.
```
</pre>

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Set Up the Python Environment

You have two options:

---

### üß™ Option A: Using Terminal (Recommended for reproducibility)

#### 1. Create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n afccp python=3.10 -y
```

#### 2. Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate afccp
```

#### 3. Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Launch PyCharm, and **select this environment** when opening the project:
   File > Settings > Project: afccp > Python Interpreter > Add > Conda Environment > Existing environment

---

### üíª Option B: Using PyCharm (GUI)

#### 1. Open **PyCharm** and select:
   - `Open Project` ‚Üí navigate to and select the cloned `afccp/` directory.

#### 2. Go to:
   - `PyCharm > Preferences` (Mac) or `File > Settings` (Windows)

#### 3. Navigate to:
   - `Project: afccp > Python Interpreter`

#### 4. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon ‚Üí `Add Interpreter` ‚Üí `Conda Environment`.

#### 5. Choose:
   - `New environment` (or Existing if you‚Äôve already created one)
   - Python version: **3.10**

#### 6. Once created, click **OK**, and PyCharm will create and set up the interpreter.

#### 7. Now install the dependencies:
   - Open the built-in PyCharm Terminal
   - Run:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

---

## üõ† 4. Run an Example

Perhaps you're using the terminal and want to test the repo to make sure it works. You can run my example script 
"example.py" that is currently sitting in the root directory.

```bash
python example.py
```

The code inside this script is quite simple, but demonstrates a bit of the scope of afccp. The python code is:

```python

# Load the main afccp object
from afccp import CadetCareerProblem

# Generate a random instance of data with 20 cadets, 5 AFSCs, and 4 AFSC preferences
instance = CadetCareerProblem(N=20, M=5, P=4, printing=True)
instance.fix_generated_data(printing=False)  # Fix the data to appropriately align assumptions

# Formulate and solve the "Hospital/Residents" problem, then export all the data back to the instances folder 
instance.classic_hr()
instance.export_data()

```

This script will generate a small test example containing all the necessary input files to run a cadet-AFSC problem
instance. It will solve that randomly generated instance using the Hospital/Residents algorithm and will export 
all the data back to csvs. If you've followed the instructions thus far and have correctly initialized the repo,
you should see an output that looks something like this:

<pre>
```bash
$ python example.py

```
</pre>

If successful, you should see a new "Random_1" data folder inside your constructed "instances" folder. The instances
folder is located in the root directory:

```plaintext
afccp/                 # Root directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ instances/         # Problem data folder (generated from afccp)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Random_1/       # Specific problem instance (newly generated data)
```

For more information on the instance data structure used by afccp, please refer to the
[Data](../../../../../afccp/reference/data) module.

---

## 5. Install Pyomo Solvers

One very important step is the setup of the optimization **solvers** used by Pyomo.

- The `solvers/` folder will be automatically created the first time you import the `afccp` module.
- You can manually place solver executables in this folder (e.g., `baron`, `bonmin`, `couenne`, `cbc`, etc.).
  
### üîß Recommended Method for Solver Setup:

1. Go to the [AMPL download portal](https://portal.ampl.com/user/ampl/download/list).
2. Under **COIN-OR solvers**, choose the appropriate compressed "coin" package for your operating system.
   
    - This page has undergone changes, and so I have no guarantee what it'll look like in the future. 
    - As of right now (June 2025), you can scroll down to the "Individual Modules" section, and select the version of
the COIN-OR solver collection that fits your operating system (MacOS or Windows):
        <p align="center">
            <img src="/afccp/images/getting-started/pic1.png" width="500px">
        </p>
    
3. Download and extract the ZIP file.
4. Locate the solver executables inside (e.g., `cbc.exe` on Windows or `cbc` on Unix-based systems).
5. Drag those solver executables into the `solvers/` folder in your working directory (the same directory as your `afccp/` project).

‚úÖ Once placed, `afccp` will detect and use the solvers when solving Pyomo models.

> üîí Note: Make sure the solver files have execution permissions (e.g., `chmod +x cbc`) on Mac/Linux.

### üß™ Solver Test

The main solver used for the majority of the afccp models is the **CBC solver**. Let's make sure
it is working with Pyomo in your `afccp` environment.

---

#### üìã Test Script

Copy the following code into a file called `test_solver.py` in your project root:

```python
from pyomo.environ import *

# Define a simple model
model = ConcreteModel()

# Variables
model.x = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)
model.y = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)

# Objective: Maximize 3x + 4y
model.obj = Objective(expr=3 * model.x + 4 * model.y, sense=maximize)

# Constraint: x + 2y <= 8
model.constraint = Constraint(expr=model.x + 2 * model.y <= 8)

# Solve with CBC
solver = SolverFactory("cbc")
result = solver.solve(model, tee=True)

# Print results
print(f"x = {model.x():.2f}")
print(f"y = {model.y():.2f}")
print(f"Objective = {model.obj():.2f}")
```

---

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Script

In your terminal (with your virtual environment activated):

```bash
python test_solver.py
```

---

#### ‚úÖ Expected Output

If CBC is correctly configured, you should see output similar to:

```
Welcome to the CBC MILP Solver
...

x = 8.00
y = 0.00
Objective = 24.00
```

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you see an error like:

```
ApplicationError: No executable found for solver 'cbc'
```

That means Pyomo cannot find the CBC executable. Here are your options:

##### ‚úÖ Option 1: Verify the solver location

Make sure that:

- You've downloaded CBC from the [AMPL coin-or page](https://portal.ampl.com/user/ampl/download/list)
- You extracted the ZIP file and found the `cbc` (or `cbc.exe` on Windows) executable
- You moved that file into your project's `solvers/` folder (this folder is created after first importing `afccp`)
- On Mac/Linux, the file is executable:  
  ```bash
  chmod +x solvers/cbc
  ```

---

##### ‚úÖ Option 2: Provide the full path to the CBC executable

If Pyomo still can‚Äôt detect it, specify the full path to the solver manually:

```python
from pyomo.environ import *

solver = SolverFactory("cbc", executable="solvers/cbc")  # or "solvers/cbc.exe" on Windows
```

This bypasses the PATH lookup and tells Pyomo exactly where to find CBC.

> üß™ You can also test this directly in the Python console to verify that it resolves:

```python
from pyomo.environ import *
SolverFactory("cbc", executable="solvers/cbc").available()
```

It should return `True` if CBC is accessible and working.

---

Once CBC is properly located and executable, your test model should run without errors.

## üìÅ 6. Project Structure
