# Tutorial 2: Data Overview

In this second tutorial, we'll explain the contents of the `data` module within `afccp`, as well as how the data itself 
is structured in the [CadetCareerProblem](../../../afccp/reference/main/cadetcareerproblem_overview/) object.

---

## 1. Data Module

A `CadetCareerProblem` instance comes with a lot of data, and so the largest section of this tutorial is here to 
talk about that data. I'll outline where the data is coming from (the various csvs), how the data is captured within 
the `CadetCareerProblem` class, and where the code is that manages all of it. 

### afccp.data

The "data" module of afccp contains the scripts and functions that all have something to do with processing the 
many sets and parameters of the problem. At a high level the modules are set up like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

The "adjustments.py" script holds the functions that manipulate the parameters. There is also a function that sanity 
checks many sets and subsets of parameters here which is extremely important in avoiding preventable errors. 
For generating simulated data, "generation.py" contains those functions, and "custom_ctgan_constraints.py" contains some
constraints for the CTGAN model used to generate realistic cadet data. Because I ended up making quite a 
few functions that deal with cadet and AFSC preferences, I took those and put them into "preferences.py". 
For importing and exporting data, as well as handling some file information, we have "processing.py". 
There are a few functions designated to support CadetCareerProblem and its hyperparameters and whatnot, 
so I put those into "support.py". Lastly, the value parameters, which I will discuss later, are all mostly handled by 
"values.py".

#### Hyperparameters: `mdl_p`

One thing I do across all my .py scripts is import each afccp module directly so that you can see which modules are 
dependent on each other. All the core scripts get imported directly into "main" since this serves as the hub for all 
the functionality of afccp. In other scripts, the modules imported are only the ones that are required. 
Another thing I do for context is include the entire module "path" in front of each function when I call it so that 
you can see where the function is written. For example, if I wanted to call the function that defines all afccp model 
hyperparameters (`mdl_p`), I can do so like this:

```python
# Import the "data.support" module (this would be at the top of the script)
import afccp.data.support

# Call the specific function from that script (this example returns a dictionary of default "hyper-parameters")
mdl_p = afccp.data.support.initialize_instance_functional_parameters(N=20)  # Requires the number of cadets

# There is a lot of information in here used across afccp
print(mdl_p['figsize'])  # This is the default figure size for my matplotlib plots!
```

The output, the default figure size of the matplotlib charts:

```
(19, 10)
```

### ðŸŽ² Generating Data

CadetCareerProblem allows for "fake" class years using simulated data generated through various means. 
You may or may not have real class year data, but we can generate data to play around with here:

```python
# Create a randomly generated problem instance with 20 cadets and 4 AFSCs
instance = CadetCareerProblem('Random', N=20, M=4, P=4)
```
??? note "ðŸ’» Console Output"
    ```text
    Generating 'Random_1' instance...
    Instance 'Random_1' initialized.
    ```

That one line above initializes a new instance of the cadetâ€“AFSC matching problem (`CadetCareerProblem`).  
`N` is the number of cadets, `M` is the number of AFSCs, and `P` is the number of preferences the cadets are allowed to express.  
Originally, cadets could only express six preferences, but today they're able to provide complete preference lists.  
I recommend **always setting `P = M`** for full preference rankings.

!!! note "ðŸ’¡ What is `data_name`?"
    The first parameter in `CadetCareerProblem('Random', N=20, M=4, P=4)` is referred to as the **data name**.  
    When generating data, you can simply pass `"Random"` and the system will automatically create the next instance
    (e.g., `"Random_1"`) based on what already exists in your `instances` folder.  

Since we havenâ€™t generated or exported any data yet, this will create a new in-memory instance called `"Random_1"`.  
**There will be no folder named `Random_1` yet** â€” we delay that until you explicitly call `instance.export_data()`  
to avoid cluttering your working directory.

The next code block prepares the generated data to be exported as CSVs so we can reference them in other examples.  
This block is **only needed for generated data** and is included here to give you a clean dataset to import and follow along with.
You donâ€™t need to worry about this yet â€” just know that once it's exported, you can reload the same instance later.

```python
# Fix "Random" data (only meant for generated data!!)
instance.fix_generated_data()
```
??? note "ðŸ’» Console Output"
    ```text

    ```

There are certainly a lot of things that happen when we "fix" the generated data. I will describe these steps in more
detail later, but for more information on what is happening please refer to the 
[fix_generated_data()](../../../afccp/reference/main/cadetcareerproblem_generated_data_corrections/) method. 
Now we can [export](../../../afccp/reference/main/cadetcareerproblem_generated_export_data/) the data!

```python
# Export everything
instance.export_data()
```

??? note "ðŸ’» Console Output"
    ```text
    Exporting datasets ['Cadets', 'AFSCs', 'Preferences', 'Goal Programming', 'Value Parameters', 'Solutions', 'Additional', 'Base Solutions', 'Course Solutions']
    ```

### Instance Folder Structure

Now that we've exported the data (after manipulating it a little), you should have a "Random_1" sub-folder within your 
"instances" folder:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/afccp/images/user-guide/pic4.png" width="700px">
</p>

You have data now located within the "Random_1" sub-folder. There are 5 instance sub-folders that get created:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/afccp/images/user-guide/pic5.png" width="700px">
</p>

The first 3 all relate to the pre-processing "phases" that AFPC/DSYA goes through to get the data into the problem 
instance format and are irrelevant for this tutorial. For a real class year of cadets/AFSCs, these 3 sub-folders will 
be filled with real data in order to get it into sub-folder "4. Model Input". 

Since we've generated data, all of these parameters are located in this sub-folder:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/afccp/images/user-guide/pic6.png" width="700px">
</p>

The files shown above, and which you should also have if you're following along, contain all the information stored in 
the data dictionaries "parameters" and "value_parameters". In a moment I will discuss what that data looks like and how 
it's stored in this dictionary structure. Lastly, let's re-import the "Random_1" problem instance:

### Importing Data

To import data, it is very simple: specify the "data_name" of the instance you want to import. 
Here, we will import "Random_1":

```python
# Import "Random_1" instance
instance = CadetCareerProblem('Random_1')
```

??? note "ðŸ’» Console Output"
    ```text
    Importing 'Random_1' instance...
    Instance 'Random_1' initialized.
    ```

At this point, we're ready to dive into the different data elements and structures used within 
[CadetCareerProblem](../../../afccp/reference/main/cadetcareerproblem_overview/). 

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

In this tutorial:

- We introduced the `data` module within `afccp`, which handles most of the parameter creation and manipulation logic.
- We broke down the purpose of each submodule in `afccp.data`:
    - `adjustments.py`: for manipulating and validating parameters  
    - `generation.py`: for generating synthetic cadet/AFSC data  
    - `preferences.py`: for managing preference matrices  
    - `processing.py`: for importing/exporting data files  
    - `support.py`: for CadetCareerProblem support functions  
    - `values.py`: for creating and managing value parameters
- We explained the role of `mdl_p`, the instance hyperparameter dictionary used across modules.
- We demonstrated how to generate synthetic data using `CadetCareerProblem('Random', N=20, M=4, P=4)`.
- We showed how to fix and export that generated data using `instance.fix_generated_data()` and `instance.export_data()`.
- We visualized how that data is stored within the "instances" folder.
- We described how to import a saved problem instance using `CadetCareerProblem('Random_1')`.

Youâ€™re now ready to explore the different data elements and structures in [Tutorial 3](../user-guide/tutorial_3.md)!
